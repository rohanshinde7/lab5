#Lab5

This Lab 5 project is a React-based personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects. The website demonstrates front-end development using React, React Router, and Bootstrap 5, along with responsive design principles. It includes multiple pages (Home, About, Projects), a carousel, and a reusable Header and Footer component. A 404 page is also implemented to handle unknown routes.
